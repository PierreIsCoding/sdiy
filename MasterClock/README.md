# MasterClock for Synth DIY
Master Clock is an Arduino Nano based Eurorack clock module. It is a fairly simple but usefull module for any DIY synthesizer enthusiast.
## Features
- 3 digit segment display
- 1 main output pulse and 3 multiplied clocked output pulses
  - First: the main "Beats Per Minute" tempo is displayed by the 3 segment display
  - Second: 2 times faster
  - Third: 4 times faster
  - Forth: 8 times faster
- A rotary encoder to change the speed. By using the encoder push button the master clock toggles between fine or course increments
- Four utility buttons:
  - Start and stop the clock
  - Tap tempo. The clock will estimate your tapped speed
  - Duty Cycle. Press the Duty Cycle button and change the duty cycle of all of the output pulses
  - Swing. Change the time between pulses to get a more groovy feeling
## Files
The following files are included:
- PDF of schematic
- PDF of perfboard helper. It is not complete, but this will help you
- Arduino Files
- 3D print .STL files. I 3D print all my panels.
## Bugs & Fixes
Please be informed that I, although having a technical background, am an electronics hobbyist. I build and share my project for fun and learning, so please let me know if you have any good improvements in mind!
