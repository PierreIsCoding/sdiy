# SDIY Building Blocks



The popular "SDIY Building Blocks" Github page needed a make-over for getting to the next level. Therefore I descided to create a dedicated site for it. Please see link: [pierreiscoding.github.io/building](https://pierreiscoding.github.io/building/)

This new version has many more circuits and explanations! PS, I will add the https certificate asap.

See [here for link to old Github version](https://github.com/PierreIsCoding/sdiy/blob/main/Building_Blocks/README_OLD.md)
